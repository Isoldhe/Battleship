# Battleship
Battleship is originally a simple board game where two players face off against eachother. Each player has 5 ships and places them on their own personal grid horizontally or vertically. None of the boats may touch eachother, not even diagonally. Then the players will call out coordinates where they attempt to fire on their opponent's boats. The opponent would then call out "Hit!" or "Miss!". This continues until all ships of one player have been fully destroyed. 

# The project
This version of Battleship is a console game in C#. The initial version is supposed to be a clone of the board game, playable against an AI. After that come several phases of possibilities to be considered, to make the game more interesting. Ideas include things like multiplayer over network, a bigger grid, special kinds of shots that hit multiple grid cells, AIs with different names and tactics or even real-time combat and movement.
